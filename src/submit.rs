    /// [CancelBuilder](types::CancelBuilder) builder supports describing the match criteria for cancellation.
    ///
    /// An optional `timeout` can be provided to specify how long to wait for matched requests to be
    /// canceled. If no timeout is provided, the default is to wait indefinitely.
    ///
    /// ### Errors
    ///
    /// If no requests are matched, returns:
    ///
    /// [io::ErrorKind::NotFound]: `No such file or directory (os error 2)`
    ///
    /// If a timeout is supplied, and the timeout elapses prior to all requests being canceled, returns:
    ///
    /// [io::ErrorKind::Uncategorized]: `Timer expired (os error 62)`
    ///
    /// ### Notes
    ///
    /// Only requests which have been submitted to the ring will be considered for cancellation. Requests
    /// which have been written to the SQ, but not submitted, will not be canceled.
    ///
    /// Available since 6.0.
