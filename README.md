The [`io_uring`](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf) userspace interface for Rust.

## Safety

All APIs are safe except for pushing entries into submission queue.
This means that the developer must ensure that entry is valid, otherwise it will cause UB.

I am trying to develop a proactor library to provide a safety abstraction.

## Why Rust ?

I don't think it needs a special reason.

The `io_uring` api design is so simple and elegant
that implementing the new `io_uring` library is not much more complicated than wrapping `liburing`.

This has some advantages over wrapping c library,
it have more freedom (see concurrent mod), and it can be easier to static link.
